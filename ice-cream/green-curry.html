        while watching <a class="external" href="https://youtu.be/tjmzfOUOw08">bdg's ice cream video</a>
        the other day, i thought to myself, i wonder what else is already kinda coconutty?
        and so here we are
    </p>

    <p class="subheading">(pawpaw swirl idea from tay)</p>

    <h2>the ice cream</h2>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>400ml coconut milk</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup sugar</li>
        <li>about &frac34; of a 270ml can of coconut cream (i didn't measure this at all)</li>
        <li>6? kaffir lime leaves (2 whole, the rest chopped)</li>
        <li>about a thumb-sized (my thumb) amount of ginger (frozen and thawed because that's what we had)</li>
        <li>a loose handful of coriander</li>
        <li>the zest of about a quarter of a kaffir lime (more if you have more patience than i do)</li>
        <li>1.5ish tbsp green curry paste</li>
        <li>1.5ish tsp lemongrass paste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>combine the coconut cream and sugar together until the sugar has dissolved</li>
        <li>put in the fridge cos the rest is going to take a while</li>
        <li>combine the rest (sans lemongrass paste because i forgot it was there) in a saucepan</li>
        <li>heat up, let simmer for a little bit, then let it sit all together in the fridge for a bit</li>
        <li>strain the stuff out of the coconut milk; combine with the cream</li>
        <li>(optional: keep the pulp to marinate other stuff with later)</li>
        <li>freeze, whisking occasionally (or use an ice cream maker)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>the pawpaw</h2>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        i probably could have just included it raw but the futzing goblin on my shoulder was like
        'we should do something to this'
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&frac14; of a red pawpaw, blended (&sim;400ml)</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup sugar</li>
        <li>the tiniest smidge of kaffir lime juice (i used a quarter of one and had to add the rest
            of the puree in to cancel it out)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>combine in a pan</li>
        <li>heat up</li>
        <li>cool in the fridge</li>
        <li>fold in to the rest once they're both ready</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>results</h2>
    <p>
        this tastes bomb as hell and you should absolutely make some
