    <h1>olive??</h1>

        class="internal" href="../index.html">home</a></p>

    <p class="date">from april 2023, probably, written in may</p>
    <p>what would possess a person to make olive ice cream, you ask?</p>
    <p>what an excellent question&mdash;my loved ones eagerly await an answer.</p>

    <p>picture it: warm weather, jar of olives on the table... an idea struck and would not let go.</p>

    <h2>the first attempt</h2>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="general-text no-list-style">
        <li>1 tbsp kalamata olives</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>method</h3>
    <p>
        knowing a first attempt was unlikely to be any good, I decided to adapt
        <a class="external" href="https://www.sugarhero.com/fresh-mint-semifreddo/">a semifreddo recipe</a> which I've
        previously had some success with to take even less time and effort than it usually does, as well
        as keeping the batch small and splitting it in two to try both a sweet and savoury version.
        the process itself followed roughly the same general vibe as the recipe linked above:
    </p>

    <ol class="general-text">
        <li>chop olives</li>
        <li>make 'custard' - in this case, whisking the egg yolk (I can't remember if I added sugar here or not)</li>
        <li>add olives</li>
        <li>whip cream to stiff peaks; add to olives/yolk</li>
        <li>whip egg whites to stiff peaks; add to the mixture</li>
        <li>split into two jars</li>
        <li>season to taste</li>
        <li>freeze for a few hours</li>
        <li>days later, remember having intended to add vanilla to the sweet one</li>
        <li>melt it down</li>
        <li>add vanilla</li>
        <li>refreeze</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>outcomes</h3>
    <p>well. it wasn't good.</p>
    <p>in fairness, though, I did end up liking the sweet one, in some strange way, and I do intend to try again and
        hopefully do it better next time.</p>

    <h3>changes for next time</h3>
    <ul class="general-text">
        <li>blend olives instead of just chopping them small</li>
        <li>???</li>
        <li>more investigation needed</li>
    </ul>
