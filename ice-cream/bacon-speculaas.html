        we had some leftover biscuits from eurovision, where we'd decided to bring snacks from the countries
        represented in the finals, so I figured it might be fun to make an ice cream from what was left.
    </p>
    <p>
        but we simply couldn't just make a normal ice cream flavour, so&hellip;
    </p>

    <p>
        the recipe for this is once again adapted from the
        <a class="external" href="https://www.sugarhero.com/fresh-mint-semifreddo/">semifreddo recipe</a> mentioned in
        the <a class="internal" href="./olive.html">last post</a>, but adapted for the ingredients we had (no white sugar),
        and the fact that I didn't want to put brown sugar in the meringue. additionally, I was going from memory the
        whole time, so in all honesty I actually have no idea if it bears any resemblance to the original recipe.
    </p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="general-text no-list-style">
        <li>6&ndash;9 speculaas biscuits</li>
        <li>4 pieces of short cut bacon, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>3 eggs, separated</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>100&ndash;150ml heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>method</h2>

    <h3>toppings</h3>
    <ol class="general-text">
        <li>cook the bacon until nicely browned and crispy (you could fry it but I baked it in the oven)</li>
        <li>crush (or blend) 4 of the biscuits into crumbs</li>
        <li>break the rest of the biscuits into chunks</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>the custard base</h3>
    <ol class="general-text">
        <li>combine the egg yolks with the sugar; whisk to combine</li>
        <li>continue whisking the egg mixture over a simmering pot of water until the sugar starts to dissolve</li>
        <li>remove from heat; continue whisking (it should get lighter in colour)</li>
        <li>repeat steps 2 and 3 if the vibes are right I guess</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="subheading">
        note: don't let the egg cook too much or it'll taste incredibly eggy!
    </p>

    <h3>the rest</h3>
    <ol class="general-text">
        <li>whip the egg whites to stiff peaks (opt. add cream of tartar and/or sugar if you have it)</li>
        <li>whip the cream to stiff peaks (soft in my case as I used a mini blender and didn't want to overdo it)</li>
        <li>add the whipped cream to the yolk mixture</li>
        <li>add the egg whites; fold together</li>
        <li>add bacon and biscuit crumbs</li>
        <li>layer biscuit chunks and the mixture in a container</li>
        <li>freeze until solid</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>the result</h2>
    <p>
        it's&hellip; pretty good? it's definitely a two-part experience, with the biscuit flavour at the forefront
        and the bacon only coming through at the end (which makes sense with its texture), but I rather like it.
    </p>

    <h2>changes for next time</h2>
    <ul class="general-text">
        <li>use a normal hand mixer for the whipped cream instead of the tiny blender
            (not worth the effort and a lot gets left behind)</li>
        <li>maybe save some bacon to crush smaller so it spreads more evenly and isn't always left to chew on
            at the end
        </li>
    </ul>
