        i was growing sunflowers out the front of the house and harvested a few of the heads way too early,
        but as i was taking the little flowers off to check the seeds they smelled really lovely, so i made
        a syrup and asked for suggestions on my instagram story, and two people suggested i make ice cream!
        so here we are
    </p>

    <h2>the syrup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>the little flowers on the face of the sunflower heads</li>
        <li>the green pointy leaves behind the head (couldn't be bothered to take them out)</li>
        <li>water, until the flower bits were covered (1.5 cups)</li>
        <li>sugar to match the water (1.5 cups)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>heated it up, let it sit, refrigerated it, took the solids out the next day</p>

    <h2>the ice cream</h2>
    <p>
        this will once again end up more of a semifreddo because i don't have an ice cream churner and don't want
        to have to keep taking it out and whisking it as it freezes
    </p>

    <h2>ingredients (approximate because i forgot to write it down)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>&frac13; cup sunflower syrup</li>
        <li>3 eggs, separated
        <li>&frac14; cup sugar</li>
        <li>&frac12; cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>vanilla to taste</li>
        <li>extra sunflower syrup to taste</li>
    </ul>
