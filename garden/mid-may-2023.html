        marigolds: 2 surviving, slowly growing real leaves&mdash;poor
        timing on my part in germinating them but it is what it is
    </p>

    <p>saffron: 2 doing well, waiting on the third</p>

    <p>
        jonquils: gently peeking out of the soil! I am looking forward
        to watching them grow over the coming months
    </p>

    <p>
        mystery pot: I have no idea what's going on here but there's
        definitely something happening!

    <p>rose: doing her best, does not know what she's in for</p>
