        strawberries: flowering and fruiting! we've had some lovely strawberries but
        unfortunately the rats seem to agree
        <br>
        hyacinths: i don't expect much from them this year as the bulbs had split into tiny babies but they're
        growing well!
        <br>
        jonquils and nasturtium out the front: doing well! a couple nasturtium flowers
        <br>
        snowflakes, sweet potatoes, mystery bulbs: all growing well together! a few of the snowflakes have
        flowered and i'm looking forward to a couple more
        <br>
        rainbow chard: growing well, when the animals aren't eating it!
        <br>
        arrowroot, sugar cane: planted, we'll see if they grow
