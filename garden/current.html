        rose: ooh she's going through it&mdash;got absolutely demolished by caterpillars earlier this month,
        plus mealybugs as well, so i gave her a big pruning and we're going to cross our fingers and hope
        <br>
        peace lily: all three got caterpillars but the smallest one got the most eaten so she's inside for now
        <br>
        sunflowers: doing well! flowered, waiting for the heads to be ready for seeds (see
        <a class="internal" href="../ice-cream/sunflower.html">the sunflower ice cream post</a>)
        <br>
        bat flower: doing well and looking very cool!
        <br>
        dahlia: surviving, getting a little eaten but not too badly!
        <br>
        strawberries: very very mixed bag here but overall not too bad
