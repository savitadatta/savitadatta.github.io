    <p class="date">early june 2023</p>
    <p>
        marigolds: both still alive, a few real leaves but it's slow going with this weather
    </p>

    <p>saffron: no news is&hellip;no news</p>

    <p>
        jonquils: most&mdash;if not all&mdash;have sprouted! averaging a couple inches in height
    </p>

    <p>
        mystery pot 1: mostly something long and gently stringy, but a few gladioli which I'm desperately
        hoping make it to the flowering stage this time
    </p>

    <p>
        mystery pot 2: hyacinths (probably)! just peeking out of the soil by a couple cm but they're looking
        cheery and in reasonably good health
    </p>

    <p>rose: three flowers! I'll try take a photo of them later</p>
