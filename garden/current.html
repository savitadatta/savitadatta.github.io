    <p class="date">mid june 2023</p>
    <p>
        marigolds, saffron: you know what they say&mdash;no news is no news
    </p>

    <p>
        jonquils: probably around half a foot in height, I've added some old grass clippings as mulch
        (it's a wonder they've grown so well so far, considering I've only watered them about 5 times since planting!)
    </p>

    <p>
        mystery pot 1: about the same as last time&mdash;a hodgepodge of lovely little babies doing their best
    </p>

    <p>
        mystery pot 2 (probably hyacinths): maybe about 2in tall, a bit stringy but I didn't expect them to
        flower this year anyway
    </p>

    <p>
        definitely hyacinth pots: coming out of the soil! probably about an inch or so tall currently
    </p>

    <p>rose: she was a bit sad after having to host three flowers
        but looking much better after a trim and some time in the sun!</p>

    <p>
        ginger, orangeberry: planted, but not expecting to see them until the warmer months
    </p>
