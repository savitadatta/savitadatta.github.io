    <h1>the blanket hoodie</h1>
    <p class="subheading"><a
        class="internal" href="../index.html">home</a></p>

    <p class="date">may 2023, from december 2022</p>

    <h2>context</h2>
    <p>picture it: december in south-east queensland&mdash;what better time to make an oversized hoodie
    out of a blanket? but as it happens I was looking for a soft throw blanket and found an idea (and also
    the blanket).</p>

    <p>
        the issue I've always had with commercially-available Comically Large Hoodies is that (in addition to being
        rather pricey) they're always far too warm for this climate and so incredibly large that they actually
        become a liability, so when the opportunity arose to make my own, I leapt at the opportunity.
    </p>

    <h2>planning</h2>
    <h3>the design</h3>
    <p>
        any hoodie worth its salt has four main sections: a hood, the body, sleeves, and at least one pocket. in this
        case I wanted the pocket to be a single large one in the centre, and for the neckline to be a v-neck instead of
        a crewneck or zipper, simply because that's how I like my hoodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        it was important to me that, while still being massively oversized, the sleeves and body wouldn't be a hazard
        in everyday functioning, as they often are, especially given my size. as a result, the ideal sleeve length was
        at maximum down to the ends of my fingertips, but not any further, and the body would be at most knee length.
    </p>

    <h3>the measurements</h3>
    <p>
        looking at the dimensions provided by free patterns online yielded massive ranges for 'one size fits all'
        garments, with some maximum lengths being in the range of 150&ndash;200% of the smallest lengths for those
        pieces&mdash;if I recall correctly, the recommended sleeve length was anywhere from 60 to 120 centimetres
        (unfortunately I have misplaced the notebook where I took the original notes).
    </p>
    <p>
        additionally, without an idea of how the various measurements feel in terms of actual fit, it was difficult
        to conceptualise the ideal shape of the hoodie based on my goals. with this in mind, I asked a friend with
        a large jumper if I could borrow his, try it on for size, and adjust the measurements accordingly.
    </p>

            my plan for the hoodie's measurements (all approximate): sleeve 60&times;20cm, body about 80&times;80cm,
            hood and pocket both about 30&times;40cm.
        </em></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>the layout</h3>
    <p>
        unfortunately the details are lost with the notebook I wrote them in, but the general plan was to have the
        body pieces on adjacent corners of the throw, one side's existing hem cut off, such that the bottom hem was
        already finished; the sleeves would be positioned with their ends on the same finished hems as the body
        pieces; and the rest would fit wherever was available on the remaining fabric.
    </p>

    <h2>construction</h2>
    <h3>cutting it out</h3>
    <p>
        so, I definitely should have used some sort of mask&mdash;from the first snip of the scissors until days after
        I'd finished, the air was thick with blanket fluff. aside from that, though, it was all pretty uneventful.
    </p>
    <p>
        the good thing about the hoodie being massive was that the precise measurements didn't matter too much,
        which was fantastic, as the only real measurements I made were along the straight lines to ensure they weren't
        too wonky. the rest of it (neckline, armscyes, sleeve heads) were entirely measured with my hands and a
        "what's the worst that could happen?" attitude.
    </p>

    <h3>actual sewing</h3>
    <p>
        I'd heard that a zigzag stitch was best for stretchy fabrics, but most of the time the sewing machine simply
        did not want to cooperate, so I mostly just used the straight stitch and hoped for the best. additionally,
        every so often the thread spool would jump and tangle horribly, but in the spirit of persistence and a lack
        of people to ask right at that very moment, I continued purely on optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
        (I later found out that I should probably invest in needles that are actually meant for working with
        stretchy fabric, but that's still on the to-do list.)
    </p>
    <p>
        an overview of the general process I followed:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>cut an approximate hood shape</li>
        <li>sew the top together</li>
        <li>fold back piece in half</li>
        <li>cut out a slight curve in the centre top for the back of the hood</li>
        <li>fold front piece in half</li>
        <li>cut a line down the centre for the v-neck</li>
        <li>starting from the edges, sew the shoulders up to where the curve starts</li>
        <li>align the back of the hood with the centre of the back piece</li>
        <li>sew the hood on</li>
        <li>be immensely surprised that it actually lines up pretty much perfectly</li>
        <li>align tops of sleeves with the shoulder join</li>
        <li>attach sleeves to armscyes</li>
        <li>sew sleeves and sides shut</li>
        <li>attach pocket to front</li>
        <li>realise that the room and your lungs are full of blanket fluff</li>
        <li>be incredibly warm</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>outcomes</h2>
    <p>
        somehow, despite the amount of guesswork involved, it turned out pretty dang well! the sleeves didn't turn
        out as wide as I'd originally planned, but in my opinion it's just right, and that's the only one that
        really matters as I'm the only person wearing it.
    </p>
    <p>
        as of the time of writing this post I've only used the hoodie once&mdash;while watching eurovision with my
        dear friends&mdash;however, let it suffice to say that it's done the job wonderfully. perfectly sized, big
        enough to sit cross-legged under without being unwieldy, and beautifully warm without being uncomfortable.
        I will say that the pocket could do with some strengthening, as it's made of a single layer of stretchy
        material, but overall I'm pretty chuffed with how it turned out :)
