    <h2>context</h2>
    <p>picture it: december in south-east queensland&mdash;what better time to make an oversized hoodie
    out of a blanket? but as it happens I was looking for a soft throw blanket and found an idea (and also
    the blanket).</p>

    <p>
        the issue I've always had with commercially-available Comically Large Hoodies is that (in addition to being
        rather pricey) they're always far too warm for this climate and so incredibly large that they actually
        become a liability, so when the opportunity arose to make my own, I leapt at the opportunity.

    <p>
        as of the time of writing this post I've only used the hoodie once&mdash;while watching eurovision with my
        dear friends&mdash;however, let it suffice to say that it's done the job wonderfully. perfectly sized, big
        enough to sit cross-legged under without being unwieldy, and beautifully warm without being uncomfortable.
        I will say that the pocket could do with some strengthening, as it's made of a single layer of stretchy
        material, but overall I'm pretty chuffed with how it turned out :)
