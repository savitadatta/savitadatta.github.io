        in anticipation of the barbie movie appearing in cinemas in july, a few of us had decided to get dressed
        up for the opening night. naturally, this would involve wearing pink, but the thematic specifics were yet
        to be decided. now, I do have a pink outfit already, of course, but given the amount of time until the day
        itself, I'd also decided to do my best to create my own version of
        <a class="external" href="https://footwearnews.com/2022/fashion/celebrity-style/margot-robbie-ryan-gosling-western-wear-cowboy-boots-1203303751/">
            a specific look I'd seen</a> to wear to the movie.
    </p>

    <h2>planning</h2>
    <h3>components</h3>
    <p>
        this is a two-piece set, with flared pants and a singlet top with what looks like a combination collar-yoke.
        the top also has princess seams and two little pockets along the front seam lines, and the pants have stars
        on the flared part, along with two on the back and a decorative lace-up section at the waistband.
    </p>
    <h3>the fabric</h3>
    <p>
        I asked the girl at the fabric shop what she thought the outfit would need, and she suggested something like
        lycra, as it looked like it was made from some kind of smooth, stretchy fabric. however, I've never worked
        with anything like that before, and it was about $16/m, so I decided that the draft pattern-finding version/s
        would be with some other material, and if it works out well enough I might consider using the nice stuff.
    </p>

    <h2>first draft</h2>
    <h3>the fabric</h3>
    <p>
        the draft fabric is some smooth, stretchy material that was $2/m at the fabric shop&mdash;a win, if you ask me.
    </p>

    <h3>the pants</h3>
    <h4>the pieces</h4>
    <p>
        for the pattern pieces, I just traced some pants I already have, and cut out twice the amount I needed, in
        order to have a copy for future reference.
    </p>

    <h4>disaster and mayhem</h4>
    <p>
        in <a class="internal" href="./blanket-hoodie.html">the blanket hoodie post</a> I mentioned having some
        difficulties with the sewing machine jamming and throwing the spool all over the place&mdash;this project
        was where I finally asked for help, and was told to (a) use a straight stitch, and (b) find a needle better
        suited to handling stretchy fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
        (the project is currently on hold until this happens.)
