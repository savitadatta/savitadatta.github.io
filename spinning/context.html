    <h2>the sheep</h2>
    <p>
        long story short: my parents have a few animals, including the very best sheep in the world (I cannot
        be convinced otherwise). his mother had some trouble giving birth, and they weren't sure if the baby
        would make it, but here we are, three years on. he's been raised with a lot of interaction so he's very
        friendly and as well-mannered as can be.
    </p>

    <h2>the wool</h2>
    <p>
        at the start of this year (2023) when visiting the parents, we'd discussed shearing this particular sheep,
        as he'd never experienced it before and none of us were sure how he'd handle it. luckily for all of us,
        he was an absolute gem about it and didn't panic in the slightest!
    </p>
    <p>
        naturally, with it being his first shearing, there was a lot of very brittle wool, and plenty of debris
        throughout, but when given the opportunity to make something of the fibres, how could I say no?
    </p>

    <h2>the process</h2>
    <h3>cleaning</h3>
    <p>
        this was by far the most arduous and time-consuming step of the process&mdash;many hours were spent sitting
        on the bathroom floor, separating the locks of wool from the bags of fleece, shaking out bits of hay and
        other debris, getting several alarmingly large splinters. the more usable fibres were placed into a laundry
        bag, ready for washing.
    </p>

    <h3>combing</h3>
    <p>
        this step I mostly do bit by bit as I spin each small section of the wool, using two dog brushes. I still
        have yet to determine the best way to prepare the fibres for the way I spin them, but hopefully it won't
        be too much of an ordeal.
    </p>

    <h2>the spindles</h2>
    <p>
        from march until about halfway through may, I'd been using a makeshift spindle made from a bottle of hand
        cream rubber-banded to a crochet hook:

        however, I was recently given a lovely wooden drop spindle, which I'm currently doing my best to get used
        to using (old spindle for size):
