            the original plan was to crochet a goat using
            <a class="external" href="https://twitter.com/Gavlebocken/status/1599477976650854400?lang=en">
                a pattern shared on the goat's twitter account
            </a>, but a test run on different yarn showed it was going to be too big. the next plan was to just
            play it by ear on the dimensions, but unfortunately we had a burst pipe and had to move things around
            at home and our cotton twine got lost just in time for things to shut down for the christmas break.

            however, inspired by a trip to wētā workshop in new zealand, i decided to make a skeleton out of
            aluminium foil and fill it with some kind of paper&mdash;especially fitting as the real-life goat, being
            consumed by jackdaws, had by this point been picked apart enough to have a visible skeleton herself.

            inspired by <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A4vle_goat">the Gävle goat</a>,
            some very dear friends of mine decided we should make a little goat to burn on our friendsmas nights,
            and naturally i volunteered for the job&mdash;however, it was tricky trying to figure out what to make it
            out of that was both able to stay in place and not too hazardous to burn. unfortunately it ended up being
            incredibly last-minute, so it wasn't very good, but behold:

        <p>
            unfortunately it didn't burn very well, being made mostly of wood&mdash;the paper burnt too quickly for
            the wood to actually take any of the fire on, but it was fun while it lasted.
