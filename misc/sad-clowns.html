        <p>
            at the start of 2024, probably, i watched
            <a class="external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0QpldEWmlY">a video</a> in which someone
            had commented on the fact that their friends were all weirdly good at painting sad clowns, and i just
            kinda decided that i wanted to have that skill under my wing, i guess. combined with the fact that
            a close friend wanted to do regular arts and crafts days, i found the perfect opportunity to work on it.
