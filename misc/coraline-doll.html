        so earlier this month a lovely friend of mine was doing a little crafternoon as a bit of an
        early birthday party, and we were making little dolls of ourselves in the style of Coraline,
        you know, the movie, with the spooky little button eyes, which was very exciting. we didn't
        really know what we were doing, but decided to wing it and see how it went.

    <h2>step 1: the skeleton</h2>
    <p>
        we started off with some wire and bent it into the shape of a little guy&mdash;i ended up
        eyeballing the wire lengths, using two pieces, and twisting one down the middle to form
        a torso and legs, with the arms looping through one of the twists of the torso.
        i think i also ended up leaving a little bit bigger of a loop in the middle for the head
        foil to loop through, but i'm not entirely sure on that bit.
        the next step was making a head shape out of foil, which i then smoothed out with a spoon.
