        so earlier this month a lovely friend of mine was doing a little crafternoon as a bit of an
        early birthday party, and we were making little dolls of ourselves in the style of Coraline,
        you know, the movie, with the spooky little button eyes, which was very exciting. we didn't
        really know what we were doing, but decided to wing it and see how it went.

    <h2>step 1: the skeleton</h2>
    <p>
        we started off with some wire and bent it into the shape of a little guy&mdash;i ended up
        eyeballing the wire lengths, using two pieces, and twisting one down the middle to form
        a torso and legs, with the arms looping through one of the twists of the torso.
        i think i also ended up leaving a little bit bigger of a loop in the middle for the head
        foil to loop through, but i'm not entirely sure on that bit.
        the next step was making a head shape out of foil, which i then smoothed out with a spoon.

    <h2>the clay</h2>

        <img width="100%" src="../resources/images/coraline-doll/clay.jpeg"
            alt="the same seated figure but with a clay-coated head and little clay hands and feet">
        <figcaption>i made little hands and feet on the ends of the limbs,
            and made a flat bit to wrap around the head</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        we then baked them in the oven until set.
    </p>

    <h2>the rest</h2>
    <p>
        after the little guy had cooled, i wrapped the body in twine, made a little poncho out of a
        scrap of fabric i had from making a top once, painted the head,
        glued bits of yarn painstakingly to the head one by one, then unplied the yarn to make it curly.
        this bit took way longer than i thought it was and the glue is definitely a bit more visible than i'd
        like, but that's what happens with a hot glue gun sometimes i guess. after that, i sewed little crosses
        in the button eyes, attached the eyes to the head, and drew some eyebrows.

    <p>
        i was going to make pants but honestly it's fine as is i reckon.
