        in december we had the oddities and curiosities expo in town, and with them were some people from
        <a class="external" href="https://thesleepingsirensoddities.com/">sleeping sirens</a> leading a taxidermy
        workshop&mdash;two, actually&mdash;one on a rabbit, and one on a rat, but i only went to the rabbit one.
        some of the steps are detailed below.

    <h2>
        general process
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>remove &amp; tan the hide (already done)</li>
        <li>create shape for head out of florists' foam</li>
        <li>make eye socket dents, fill with clay &amp; place eyes</li>
        <li>shape body; stick wires through where the legs come out
            (loop other ends around so it catches in the foam)</li>
        <li>wrap polyfill around legs; wrap twine around polyfill to keep it in place</li>
        <li>use a stick to attach head to body</li>
        <li>take out some foam at the mouth; fill with clay</li>
        <li>ensure hide is dry and brushed on outside (but don't hairdry the face yet as it'll shrink)</li>
        <li>roll hide over foam creature</li>
        <li>fill legs</li>
        <li>sew hide together at spine</li>
        <li>position on mount</li>
        <li>card ears; fix face details; pin</li>
        <li>wait a fortnight</li>
    </ol>
