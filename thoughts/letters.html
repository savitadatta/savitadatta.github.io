        stamp prices have gone up 20% since 2019.
    </p>

    <p>
        one of my beautiful lighthouse stamps is no longer enough to
        send a letter to a friend, but we persist despite the Agonies (inflation).
    </p>

    <p>
        it took many months for me to write the first letter since remembering the stamps that've been in my wallet
        for the last four years, despite having had clear plans on who to write to and what to say&mdash;it's just
        always seemed like such a Task, something that would take forever and involve so much more effort
        than just shooting a message across.
    </p>

    <p>but maybe that's the whole point <span style="font-size: smaller;">(spoiler alert: it is).</span></p>

    <p>
        naturally, a big part of why i wanted to write to my friends was because it's fun&mdash;there's something
        so lovely and dramatic about sitting down with the nice paper and a bottle of ink to pen a missive to a
        distant loved one, and in addition to that it's so rare to receive mail these days in a form that isn't a
        bill, or a package, or just some local council news.
    </p>

    <p>
        but also, it's about the effort.
    </p>

    <p>
        i read <a class="external" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02654075231189899">a study</a>
        recently about effort in relationships (in an AI context) which concluded that a large part of how people
        feel about a relationship depends on the amount of effort that goes into it&mdash;this is hardly a surprise,
        but it's interesting that they wanted to prove it in an academic study as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        maybe i'm just being dramatic, but despite it being really not that difficult, there is something so
        lovely about knowing someone did want to put in the effort to write.
    </p>

    <p>
        setting aside time to sit down, figure out what to write, and commit it all to paper&mdash;along with
        sourcing materials, waiting a week for it to send, and, as i was reminded recently, having to save
        up enough things to have anything to write at all.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        in the end, it's definitely more for fun and keeping in contact with people i speak to less often than
        anything else, but i'd like to think it's a nice way to remind them that i do care about them a lot, even
        if we don't catch up very often.
    </p>

    <p>
        plus, with the weight limits on posting letters i can still enclose a little
        extra something in the envelopes, like the photos of my sweet old dog.
