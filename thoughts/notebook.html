    <p>
        i came across <a class="external" href="https://joe-cecil.com/about/">a blog</a> recently which had some
        really interesting and sometimes thought-provoking posts, which got me thinking about the fact that this
        blog's been around for a while now and it's only got one Thinking About Things Blog Post&trade; so far.
    </p>

    <p>
        part of this is the mortifying ordeal of the possibility of having people read anything i've written, and
        the fact that none of this is by any definition Good, but i'm trying to teach myself that it's okay to suck
        at things and also that this is supposed to be a fun little side project in its own right, rather than
        yet another thing to worry about.
    </p>

    <p>
        so hopefully taking inspiration from that and many other notebook blogs i might gather the courage
        to&mdash;not necessarily <em>daily</em>, but every so often&mdash;actually write something on this blog,
        and god forbid anyone read it but maybe one day there might actually be something Not Half Bad here.
