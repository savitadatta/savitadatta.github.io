        i know the phrase itself has been around for ages, but
        <a class="external" href="https://www.tumblr.com/mugofsoup/725763378691424256/">this post</a> and its
        'do it scared' have made a home in my brain, hopefully for good.
        and if not, i'll do my best to make it that way.
    </p>

    <p>
        i've been doing capoeira for a few years now (on and off&hellip; mostly off) and buying a game (entering
        the roda) still scares the shit out of me. everyone's always super encouraging about it, sometimes to
        the point where they buy the game on my behalf before i can figure it out myself, but it's with
        the best of intentions.
    </p>

    <p>
        yesterday one of the guys&mdash;he's been teaching some of the classes since at least 2019&mdash;said to me
        after training something along the lines of "sorry for always being so pushy about the games, but that's
        how you get less scared about it", and he's right, but also i've always just needed time to gather the
        courage to actually take that first step&mdash;everything after that is mostly fine.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        i've also just a few days ago taken up aerial silks, and the teacher at one point said, "i can explain for
        an hour but at some point you've just gotta do it" (and again, it was more about the courage than the
        description of what to do)
    </p>

    <p>
        and so reflecting on these things i realised that the main time sink (if you will) is just the gathering of
        courage&mdash;hardly a surprise, really, as once you start something there's only so slow it can go,
        especially when there's another person involved&mdash;but that very first step is by far the biggest hurdle
        in either process (and surely countless others).
    </p>

    <p>
        anyway, those were thoughts i had literally last night so not so much time to have put them into action,
        but i'm hoping to try to remember the 'do it scared'&mdash;especially the next few days, with the grading
        and everything else&mdash;and maybe it'll actually make a difference!
