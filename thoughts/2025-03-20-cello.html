    <p>i've started playing cello again. or at least, i'm trying to.</p>

    <p>
        she's been sitting at my front door all these years and so often i look wistfully in her direction
        and think, i really should just get back into it. it's tricky to gather the time and motivation,
        though, especially with a thousand other easier things i could be doing at any given time.
    </p>

    <p>
        a few times in the last eight years or so i have taken her out for a spin and it's always pretty
        rough, especially in terms of bow hand stamina, but also it turns out it's just kind of
        everything&mdash;from the stuff i always sucked at (bow hold technique, higher position finger shape)
        to the things that were pretty much second nature to me (knowing where the fingers should go and what
        the notes there would sound like)&mdash;that's gone to shit after close to a decade of hardly
        playing at all.
    </p>

    <p>
        i was talking to an old friend from orchestra recently, who was saying that every time he's brought
        his cello out he's just ended up so frustrated, angry even, and i get it. it's so tough coming back
        to something you once loved and feeling like it hates you (which led to me posting on my instagram
        story something like 'is this what it feels like to be divorced' but none of us would know, really),
        and that makes it even easier to just stop trying and let it collect dust in some corner somewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
        but i just can't.
    </p>

    <p>
        it was such a big part of my life&mdash;over a decade, at least (probably more), of being my main
        non-school activity, of being my creative and emotional expression, of facilitating my social life
        outside classtime, of teaching me the importance of persistence and problem solving and that doing
        something physical when you're really fucking mad about something can be incredibly cathartic&mdash;
        and i'm not willing to let the instrument (pun intended) through which all this happened fade
        into the past in the storeroom or some dusty corner.
    </p>

    <p>
        it is hard, though. it sucks so much and everything hurts and it sounds so so bad and i feel bad all
        the time about it. i used to be able to play a 15-page piece (not very well by the end, to be fair)
        and it would last about a quarter hour and that was just a thing that happened, and now i get a page
        and a half in and my hand's sore and my arms are tired and i have to take a break after the piece ends.
    </p>

    <p>
        but fortunately i can be one stubborn motherfucker&mdash;also, i recently got back in contact with my
        old orchestra conductor, who said to let him know if i wanted to be part of some big cello thing he
        was trying to put together later this year (and i did)&mdash;so at least now there's also some external
        reason in addition to my own resolution to get back into it for realsies this time.
    </p>

    <p>
        we'll see how it goes in the end, and it'll be suffering every step of the way, and at the moment
        i'm mostly just working on being able to play stuff and not get upset about how much strength and
        skill i've lost, but by god&mdash;she's been here for me all these years; it's about time i was
        there for her.
