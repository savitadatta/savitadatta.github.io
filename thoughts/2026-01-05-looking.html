    <p>
        on various occasions recently i've found myself asking people, how can i know how to tell if things
        are positioned a certain way? and unfortunately due to these lovely people having not experienced
        being new to this nearly as recently as i would have liked, their main response has been just.
        lookin'.
        so here's my list&mdash;far from exhaustive&mdash;of ways to look at things that might be helpful.
    </p>

    <h2>evenly spaced things of uneven width</h2>
    <p>
        i found with this measuring from the centre points was fine, or just unfocusing my eyes
        and going off the vibe as to whether or not it was even. but a recurring theme you may find
        in this page is that a vibe is not helpful before you've developed the eye for it, so it
        may be best to keep measuring until that happens.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>things being lined up but far away</h2>
    <p>
        there were a few different methods i used to try to eyeball something being allegedly centre-aligned
        but far enough away and with inconsistent things to measure off:
    </p>

        <h3>looking down one side at a time</h3>
        <p>
            you can look with one eye or both, and from a close distance or far away&mdash;whatever works
            for your current situation. however, if the widths aren't quite right, it might not work very well.
        </p>

        <h3>looking down the centre</h3>
        <p>
            now i've actually not tried this one as i don't quite trust my eye for seeing the centre of
            something, but i hear you can find the midpoint of both things and line them up that way.
            you can do this lining the centre up with either one eye or both, depending on how
            you intend to look at them, but be careful with the angles.
        </p>

        <h3>looking down both sides</h3>
        <p>
            on a similar note to the even spacing, you can also use both eyes and hope for them to work in
            your favour by holding the objects between your eyes and looking at the space on either side,
            or the lack thereof; however, this also
            suffers the same problem as the above of it being difficult to gauge accurately before having
            gained the eye for it. i would recommend this once you've seen a few and get an idea of how you
            hold the objects and how you look at things.
        </p>

    <h2>something being vertical to &hellip; the general vibe</h2>
    <p>
        if something's really off, you can likely just Know that it's wrong, but it's tricky the smaller
        the angles get! if you are able to and trust the shapes nearby, it can be useful to see if there
        might be anything nearby which you can compare with it; this might involve imagining squares or
        triangles joining these parts, or seeing what things might be parallel.
        looking at it from a range of distances could help, as it may reveal other reference points you
        may be neglecting; however, if that is not the case and you're not able to measure in any real way,
        you might just have to look at a bunch of things that are and aren't straight
        and hope something clicks.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>something being perpendicular to a curve</h2>
    <p>
        this one took me way longer than it should have to realise. anyway if you get something you know
        has a right angle and tilt it until the corner juuuuuust hits the surface, that should give you the
        point at which the bottom part is at a tangent to the curve.
    </p>
    
    <br>

    <h2>miscellaneous</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            if you're looking at two carved sections and trying to check if they're even, it might
            help to check both the wood and the space around it to compare the two
        </li>
        <li>don't forget eye protection!</li>
        <li>
            light can make things tricky&mdash;see if it might help to move
            either yourself or the light source (or both!)
        </li>
    </ul>
