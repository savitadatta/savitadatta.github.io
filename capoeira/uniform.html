    <h1>uniform! + pants alterations</h1>
    <p class="subheading"><a

    <p>
        so I've been going to capoeira on and off (mostly off) for a couple years now, but I haven't really
        followed up on getting a uniform for it (due to being painfully awkward)&mdash;I'll spare you the
        details but finally got around to asking about it!
    </p>
    <p>
        the thing is, for adjustability the pants come super long, so I needed to shorten them so they wouldn't
        be a tripping hazard.
    </p>

    <h2>alterations</h2>
    <h3>the needle!</h3>
    <p>
        as mentioned in <a class="internal" href="../sewing/blanket-hoodie.html">previous</a>
        <a class="internal" href="../sewing/cowboy-barbie.html">posts</a>, I needed to get some needles for working
        with stretch fabric. Spotlight conveniently had a sale on sewing machine needles, so I picked some up
        the other day!
    </p>

    <h3>getting to it</h3>
    <p>
        honestly I have no idea of the ideal length so I just made sure the fold was off the ground, measured
        an approximate length to cut off (about the length of my index finger, or roughly 7cm), and
        sewed a double hem&mdash;only made one significant mistake in folding the material to the wrong side but
        luckily it was an easy fix!
    </p>

    <h3>how's the needle?</h3>
    <p>
        well, it didn't seem to have any major difficulties! so, about the best you can expect, really.
